    "In this exercise you are going to create a neural network for regression.  \n",
    "You will use the Boston housing dataset again.  \n",
    "This time you build a 3-layer neural network using TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy paste the linear regression TensorFlow example form the lecture notes and make it work in this notebook.\n",
    "2. Change the computation graph to include a regularization term. Train the network with regularization. If you succeed in the next step, you don't need to keep this intermediate step in you notebook. Note: `lambda` is a reserved word in Python\n",
    "3. Add an extra layer. Use a `tan` function as activation. Add regularization. If you succeed in the next step, you don't need to keep this intermediate step in you notebook. Use the same regularization parameter for all layers.\n",
    "3. Add another layer with regularization\n",
    "4. Search for a good value of the hyper parameter $\\lambda$. You should have one such parameter that is used in all layers of your network. \n",
    "5. Present the results in a nice way in your notebook. Make the notebook readable. Perhaps make use of tables, plots and headers. Note that plotting is not part of this course, so you don't need to make plots."
